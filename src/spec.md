# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revamp the AMS Digital Agency marketing site frontend UI/UX to closely match the visual style and interaction patterns of seosherpa.com, while keeping AMS Digital Agency branding and content.

**Planned changes:**
- Redesign primary marketing page sections to follow an SEO Sherpa-like structure (clear top navigation, prominent hero, services/value sections, proof/metrics/testimonials, process, CTA blocks, footer) using AMS content.
- Establish and apply a consistent design system across the site (typography scale, spacing, buttons/links, cards, section padding) using composed React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui components (no edits to immutable UI sources).
- Implement SEO Sherpa-like UX details: clean/sticky header behavior as appropriate, strong visual hierarchy, reusable section components, and polished micro-interactions (hover/focus/active states, subtle transitions).
- Ensure baseline accessibility, performance, and SEO-friendly markup (logical heading hierarchy, alt text, readable contrast, visible focus indicators, stable layouts, avoid heavy assets/animations).
- Make layouts responsive across mobile/tablet/desktop with no overflow or breakpoint breakage; ensure keyboard-navigable navigation and CTAs.

**User-visible outcome:** The AMS Digital Agency site displays a modern, SEO Sherpa-inspired marketing layout with consistent styling, responsive behavior, accessible navigation/CTAs, and polished interactions—while keeping AMS branding and content in English.
