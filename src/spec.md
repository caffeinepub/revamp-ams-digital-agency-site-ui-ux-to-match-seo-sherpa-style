# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Ensure every existing site section and in-page link has complete, readable, consistently branded content for AMS Digital Agency.

**Planned changes:**
- Add an About section with `id="about"` and meaningful English copy, included in the rendered layout.
- Add complete legal sections with `id="privacy"`, `id="terms"`, and `id="cookies"` (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Cookie Policy) and ensure footer legal links scroll to these sections.
- Rewrite and standardize all existing marketing copy across current sections (Hero, Services, Proof/Metrics, Testimonials, Process, CTA, Header, Footer) to be coherent, professional English and consistently branded as “AMS Digital Agency”.
- Ensure there are no dead in-page links (all nav/footer anchors point to existing DOM ids).

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate to a fully written About section and complete legal policy sections via header/footer links, and all visible site copy reads as finalized, consistent AMS Digital Agency content with no placeholders.
