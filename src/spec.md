# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restyle the existing AMS Digital Agency single-page marketing site to closely match Vercel.com’s visual style and interaction patterns while preserving all existing content, branding, and section structure.

**Planned changes:**
- Update global design tokens and base styles to a Vercel-inspired neutral/monochrome palette with strong semantic contrast for text, borders, and surfaces (including support for light and dark modes).
- Restyle existing page sections (Header, Hero, Services, Proof, Testimonials, Process, About, CTA, Legal, Footer) to use Vercel-like layout density, typography, grid/divider-forward composition, and refined hover/focus states—without adding new pages or features.
- Adjust component compositions and section shells (wrappers, spacing, containers) to achieve consistent minimal rounding, thin borders/dividers, and subtle/no elevation, while keeping all existing anchor links and smooth scrolling behavior intact.

**User-visible outcome:** The marketing site looks and feels recognizably Vercel-inspired (clean, high-contrast, polished in light/dark mode), while all existing AMS Digital Agency sections, copy, branding, and navigation anchor links continue to work as before.
