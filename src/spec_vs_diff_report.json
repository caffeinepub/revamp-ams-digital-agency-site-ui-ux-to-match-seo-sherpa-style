  "summary": "Diff largely implements a Vercel-inspired UI refresh via updated global tokens (index.css), refined Tailwind theme, and consistent section shells/cards/header/footer styling while preserving single-page section composition and smooth scrolling behavior. One potentially unrelated addition is a new CTA email capture form handler and an added placeholder hook file summary not requested in the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "description": "CTA section implements an email submission form with React state and a submit handler that logs the email (email capture behavior), which could be considered an added product feature beyond visual/UX restyling.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly constrains the work to a visual/UX restyle and says not to introduce unrelated product features; adding form submission behavior is not described in REQ-6/REQ-7.",
