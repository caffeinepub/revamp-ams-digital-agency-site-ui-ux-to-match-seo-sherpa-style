  "summary": "The diff adds a new single-page marketing layout (header, hero, services, proof, testimonials, process, CTA, footer) with a Tailwind design system and sticky header/micro-interactions. However, some requested structure/content alignment and SEO/accessibility details are either missing or cannot be verified from the truncated diff, and a few added features (auth/actor hooks, backend stub, email capture behavior) are not requested by the build requirements.",

      "reason": "Navigation includes an \"About\" link to #about, but App.tsx does not render any About section/component, so that section structure appears incomplete/broken.",

      "reason": "Footer includes links to #privacy, #terms, and #cookies, but no corresponding sections are present in the composed page, which can harm UX/SEO (dead anchors) and navigability.",
