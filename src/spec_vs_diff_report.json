  "summary": "Diff implements TanStack Router-based multi-page structure with consistent header/footer, creates several required pages (Home, About, Portfolio + case study detail, Blogs, Contact, Reviews, Privacy, Cookie, Profile) and centralizes much content into TS data modules. However, service landing/detail page requirements and generated static assets usage cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary, and required service-icon sprite usage is not evidenced. Header nav also lacks explicit Home link and may lack Contact in the primary nav items.",

      "reason": "Routes for /services and /services/$slug are registered, but the diff summary does not include the implementations of ServicesPage.tsx or ServiceDetailPage.tsx, so the required content sections and Contact CTA per service cannot be verified.",

      "reason": "Home and case studies reference the hero and thumbnail PNG paths, but the diff summary does not show the actual static asset files under frontend/public/assets/generated, nor any usage of the required services icon sprite asset. Added files list is truncated/omitted for 2 files, so asset presence cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",
